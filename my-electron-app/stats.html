    <h1>Statistical Analysis</h1>
    <p>Here are the key statistics regarding how indices and time of year relate to fires.
        Of all the indices, the most significant one was the ISI index but a majority of them
        were insignificant, meaning that they must go through improvement or there must be 
        stronger ways to predict in advance the likelihood of a fire starting.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first thing we wanted to test was the indices of the fire season and how they
        related to the area of fire affected. We found that the ISI index was the best predictor
        but all indexes were nearly insignificant, meaning there needs to be a higher emphasis on
        other methods of fire prediction.

        We also wanted to test the relationship between our predictions on the time of year that
        would have the most are burnt to the fires. We predicted that summer time would be the greatest
        but after removing cases with nearly 0 (essentially no significant fire) our X^2 GOF test showed
        that the month values completely deviated from our expectations.
